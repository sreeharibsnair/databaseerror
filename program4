5. MAX()

SELECT DISTINCT Statement

 The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different)
values.
 Syntax:
 SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name;

ORDER BY Keyword

 The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or
descending order.
 The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To
sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.
 Syntax:
 SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;

Examples:

 Order by Single Column (Ascending – Default)
 SELECT * FROM product ORDER BY price;
 ✔ Sorts products by price in ascending order (lowest to highest)
 Order by Descending
 SELECT * FROM product ORDER BY price DESC;
 ✔ Sorts products from highest price to lowest
 Order by Multiple Columns
 SELECT * FROM customer ORDER BY city ASC, name ASC;
 ✔ First sorts by city
✔ Then sorts names within same city

 ORDER BY with WHERE
 SELECT * FROM product WHERE price < 50 ORDER BY price DESC;
 ✔ Filters first
✔ Then sorts the filtered result

MySQL AND & OR condition

 Syntax:
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 ...
OR condition_n;
 Eg:
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE (course_name = 'Java' AND student_name = 'Aryan')
OR (student_id < 2);

MySQL- IN

 used to reduce the use of multiple OR conditions in a SELECT, INSERT,
UPDATE and DELETE statemt.
 Syntax:
 expression IN (value1, value2, .... value_n);

MYSQL- NOT condition

 It is used to negate a condition in a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE
statement.
 Eg:
SELECT * FROM student
WHERE name NOT IN ('Ajeet','Vimal','Deepika');

MYSQL-NOT EQUAL

 It is used for returning a set of rows after comparing two expressions that are
not equal.
 The MySQL contains two types of Not Equal operator, which are (< >) and
(! =).
 Eg:
 SELECT * FROM students WHERE city <> "England";
 SELECT * FROM students WHERE city != "England";
 SELECT * FROM customers Where income>40000 and occupation<>"Developer";

MYSQL-BETWEEN

 specifies how to retrieve values from an expression within a specific range.
 It is used with SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statement.
 Syntax:
 expression BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
 Eg:
SELECT * FROM students WHERE id BETWEEN 1 AND 3;

MySQL- EXIST
 It is a type of Boolean operator which returns the true or false result.
 It is used in combination with a subquery and checks the existence of data in a
subquery.
 Syntax:
SELECT col_names FROM tab_name WHERE [NOT] EXISTS (
SELECT col_names FROM tab_name WHERE condition);
Eg: STUDENT { id, name, age}
MARK { id, m1,m2,grade}
 mysql> SELECT name, age FROM student
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM student
WHERE student.id = mark.id);
 Eg: mysql> SELECT name, age FROM student

WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM student
WHERE student.id = mark.id);

 Eg: mysql> DELETE FROM mark WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT * FROM student

WHERE id=3);

MySQL – IS NULL

 used to check if there is a NULL value in the expression. It is used with
SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statement.
 Syntax:
 expression IS NULL
 Eg:
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE ph_no IS NULL;

MySQL-IS NOT NULL

 used to check the NOT NULL value in the expression. It is used with SELECT,
INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statements.
 Syntax:
 expression IS NOT NULL
 Eg:
 SELECT * FROM customer WHERE ph_no IS NOT NULL;

MySQL - LIKE

 used to perform pattern matching to find the correct result.
 It is used in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statement with the
combination of WHERE clause.
 syntax:
 expression LIKE pattern [ ESCAPE 'escape_character' ]
 pattern: It is a character expression that contains pattern matching.
 escape_character: It is optional. It allows you to test for literal instances of a
wildcard character such as % or _. If you do not provide the
escape_character, MySQL assumes that "\" is the escape_character.

Cntd...

1. Using % (percent) Wildcard:
 SELECT id FROM student WHERE name LIKE ‘Ash%';
 SELECT id FROM student WHERE name LIKE ‘A%';
 SELECT id FROM student WHERE name LIKE ‘%h%';
2. Using _ (Underscore) Wildcard:
 SELECT id FROM student WHERE name LIKE ‘a_h%';
 SELECT id FROM student WHERE name LIKE ‘_ _h';
 SELECT id FROM student WHERE name LIKE ‘_ _ _';

Aggregate functions: COUNT

 MySQL count() function is used to returns the count of an expression. It
allows us to count all rows or only some rows of the table that matches a
specified condition.
 It is a type of aggregate function whose return type is BIGINT.
 This function returns 0 if it does not find any matching rows.
 We can use the count function in three forms, which are explained below:
 Count (*)
 Count (expression)
 Count (distinct)

 COUNT(*) Function: This function uses the SELECT statement to returns the
count of rows in a result set. The result set contains all Non-Null, Null, and
duplicates rows.
 COUNT(expression) Function: This function returns the result set without
containing Null rows as the result of an expression.
 COUNT(distinct expression) Function: This function returns the count of
distinct rows without containing NULL values as the result of the expression.

 Syntax:
SELECT COUNT (aggregate_expression) FROM table_name [WHERE conditions];
 Eg:
 mysql> SELECT COUNT(emp_name) FROM employees;
 mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees WHERE emp_age>32;
 mysql> SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT emp_age) FROM employees;

SUM() function

 The MySQL sum() function is used to return the total summed value of an
expression.
 It returns NULL if the result set does not have any rows. It is one of the kinds
of aggregate functions in MySQL.
 Syntax:
SELECT SUM(aggregate_expression) FROM tables [WHERE conditions];
 Eg:
 mysql> SELECT SUM(working_hours) AS "Total working hours" FROM employees;
 mysql> SELECT SUM(working_hours) AS "Total working hours" FROM employees WH
ERE working_hours>=12;

Avg () function

 The MySQL avg() is an aggregate function used to return the average
value of an expression in various records.
 Syntax:
SELECT AVG(aggregate_expression) FROM tables [WHERE conditions];
 Eg:
 mysql> SELECT AVG(working_hours) AS Avg_working_hours FROM employees;
 mysql> SELECT AVG(working_hours) AS
Avg_working_hours FROM employees WHERE working_hours>=12;

Min() function

 The MIN() function in MySQL is used to return the minimum value in a set of
values from the table.
 It is an aggregate function that is useful when we need to find the smallest
number, selecting the least expensive product, etc.
 Syntax:
SELECT MIN ( DISTINCT aggregate_expression) FROM table_name(s)
[WHERE conditions];
 Eg:
 mysql> SELECT MIN(income) AS Minimum_Income FROM employees;
 mysql> SELECT MIN(income) AS Minimum_Income FROM employees

WHERE emp_age >= 32 AND emp_age <= 40;

Max() function

 The MySQL MAX() function is used to return the maximum value in a set of
values of an expression.
 This aggregate function is useful when we need to find the maximum
number, selecting the most expensive product, or getting the largest
payment to the customer from your table.
 Syntax:
SELECT MAX(DISTINCT aggregate_expression) FROM table_name(s)
[WHERE conditions];
 Eg:
 mysql> SELECT MAX(income) AS "Maximum Income" FROM employees;
 mysql> SELECT MAX(income) AS "Maximum_Income" FROM employees

WHERE emp_age > 35;

Display first row of a table:

 The MySQL first function is used to return the first value of the selected
column.
 Here, we use limit clause to select first record or more.
 Syntax:
SELECT column_name FROM table_name LIMIT 1;
 Eg:
 SELECT officer_name FROM officers LIMIT 1;
 SELECT officer_name FROM officers LIMIT 2;


Display last row of a table:

 MySQL last function is used to return the last value of the selected column.
 Syntax:
SELECT column_name FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name DESC LIMIT 1;
 Eg:
 SELECT officer_name FROM officers ORDER BY officer_id DESC LIMIT 1;

GROUP BY

 The MYSQL GROUP BY Clause is used to collect data from multiple records
and group the result by one or more column.
 It is generally used in a SELECT statement.
 You can also use some aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX,
AVG etc. on the grouped column.
 Syntax:
SELECT expression1, expression2, ... expression_n, aggregate_function (expression)
FROM tables [WHERE conditions] GROUP BY expression1, expression2, ... expression_n;

Cntd...

 expression1, expression2, ... expression_n: It specifies the expressions that
are not encapsulated within an aggregate function and must be included
in the GROUP BY clause.
 aggregate_function: It specifies a function such as SUM, COUNT, MIN, MAX,
or AVG etc. tables: It specifies the tables, from where you want to retrieve
the records. There must be at least one table listed in the FROM clause.
 WHERE conditions: It is optional. It specifies the conditions that must be
fulfilled for the records to be selected.

Examples:

 mysql>SELECT address, COUNT(*) FROM officers GROUP BY address;
 SELECT emp_name, SUM(working_hours) AS "Total working hours"
FROM employees GROUP BY emp_name;


MySQL HAVING Clause

 MySQL HAVING Clause is used with GROUP BY clause. It always returns the
rows where condition is TRUE.
 Syntax:
 SELECT expression1, expression2, ... expression_n, aggregate_function (expr
ession) FROM tables [WHERE conditions] GROUP BY expression1, expression2
, ... expression_n HAVING condition;

Examples:

 SELECT emp_name, SUM(working_hours) AS "Total working hours"
FROM employees GROUP BY emp_name HAVING SUM(working_hours) > 5;
